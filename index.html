                                I had to build an Web App System for Air Quality Monitoring, this followed drawing diagrams of ERD models and BPMN, for the technicallity 
                                the system had to run on an web interface application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs for complete backend. Also on Microprocessor
